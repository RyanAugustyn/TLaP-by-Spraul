Problems include restraints, such as language, platform, performance. Problem solving is then writing an original program that completes particular task(s) within constraints.

No Kobayashi Maru (from the Star Trek film where the problem is avoided)

Some classic problems:

Fox, Goose, and Corn; making explicit that 'farmer has a rowboat that can be used to transfer items in either direction' makes answer more obvious.

One way is to restate is to generalize what you are trying to do, i.e. instead of 'Carry the goose to the far side of the river' change to 'If the boat is empty, load an item from the shore'. You are often forced to restate when 'rubber ducking'

Sliding puzzle; already know all possible operations, but problem is hard to know when making progress. So experiment a bit, and find a 'train' can preserve order of tiles, so can group and solve piecemeal.

Sodoku, you look for most constrained part of the problem. In AI there is the 'most constrained variable', which means that where different values are assigned to different variables, start with the one with most constraints. An analogy would be choosing lunch with a group and starting with the person with the most limited food options

Quarrasi lock in book has a lot of elaborate detail, but is just fox,goose,corn problem from before

General Problem-Solving Strategies:

- Always have a plan-allows intermediate goals and achievement
- Restate the problem-may help see in a new light, or explain better to others
- Divide the problem
- Start with what you know-working on partial solution may spark ideas
- Reduce the problem-reduce scope of problem by adding/removing constraints (say finding location in 2D space instead of 3D, or even a line)
- Look for analogies-takes time to recognize
- Experiement-some forms similar to debugging
- Don't get Frustrated-yeah, good advice don't allow yourself the indulgence
