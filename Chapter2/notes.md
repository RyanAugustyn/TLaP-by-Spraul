For problem 'print a half 5x5 triangle with hashes', one way to reduce would be starting by making a square. Then write one loop, then repeat that loop again.

Now recognize need an expression that is 5 when row is 1, 4 when row is 2, etc. If multiply row by -1 it gives the wrong numbers, but it's always off by 6 from desired value. so 6 - row. See practice for example
